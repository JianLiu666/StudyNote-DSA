'''
Next Greater Element Using a Stack

Problem Statement:
    You are required to implement the next_greater_element() function. 
    For each element i in a list, the function finds the first element to its right which is greater than element i. 
    If for any element such a value does not exist, the answer is -1.

    Note: 
        The next greater element is the first element towards the right which is greater than the given element. 
        For example, in the list [1, 3, 8, 4, 10, 5], the next greater element of 3 is 8 and the next greater element for 8 is 10.

Input:
    An integer list.

Sample Input:
    list = [4, 6, 3, 2, 8, 1]

Output:
    A list containing the next greater element of each element from the input list.

Sample Output:
    result = [6, 8, 8, 8, -1, -1]
