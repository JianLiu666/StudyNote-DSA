'''
min( ) Function Using a Stack

Problem Statement:
    You have to implement the MinStack class which will have a min() function. 
    Whenever min() is called, the minimum value of the stack is returned in O(1) time. 
    The element is not popped from the stack. Its value is simply returned.

Input:
    min() operates on an object of MinStack and doesnâ€™t take any input

Output:
    Returns minimum number in O(1) time

Sample Output:
    min_stack = [9, 3, 1, 4, 2, 5]
    min_stack.min()
    Result = 1
