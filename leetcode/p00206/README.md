# 206. Reverse Linked List

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

### Example 1:

![image](./image/rev1ex1.jpeg)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
```

### Example 2:

![image](./image/rev1ex2.jpeg)

```
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]
```

### Example 3:

```
Input: head = []
Output: []
```

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the list is the range `[0, 5000]`.
- `-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000`

#### Follow up:

A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?
