# 326. Power of Three

Given an integer `n`, return `true` if it is a power of three. Otherwise, return `false`.

An integer `n` is a power of three, if there exists an integer `x` such that n == $3^x$.

### Example 1:

```
Input: n = 27
Output: true
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: n = 0
Output: false
```

### Example 3:

```
Input: n = 9
Output: true
```

### Constraints:

- -$2^{31}$ <= n <= $2^{31}$ - 1
