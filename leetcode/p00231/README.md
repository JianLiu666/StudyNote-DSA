# 231. Power of Two

Given an integer `n`, return `true` if it is a power of two. Otherwise, return `false`.

An integer `n` is a power of two, if there exists an integer `x` such that n == $2^x$.

### Example 1:

```
Input: n = 1
Output: true

Explanation:
 - 2^0 = 1
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: n = 16
Output: true

Explanation:
 - 2^4 = 16
```

### Example 3:

```
Input: n = 3
Output: false
```

### Constraints:

$-2^{31}$ <= `n` <= $2^{31}$ - 1

#### Follow up: 

Could you solve it without loops/recursion?
