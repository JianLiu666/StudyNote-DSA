# 215. Kth Largest Element in an Array

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the $\text{k}^\text{th}$ largest element in the array.

Note that it is the $\text{k}^\text{th}$ largest element in the sorted order, not the $\text{k}^\text{th}$ distinct element.

You must solve it in `O(n)` time complexity.

### Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [3,2,1,5,6,4], k = 2
Output: 5
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6], k = 4
Output: 4
```

### Constraints:

- 1 <= k <= nums.length <= $10^5$
- -$10^4$ <= nums[i] <= $10^4$
