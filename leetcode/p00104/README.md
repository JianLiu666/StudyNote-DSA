# 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's **maximum depth** is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

### Example 1:

```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 3
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: root = [1,null,2]
Output: 2
```

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, $10^4$].
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
