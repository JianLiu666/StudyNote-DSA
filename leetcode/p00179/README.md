# 179. Largest Number

Given a list of non-negative integers `nums`, arrange them such that they form the largest number and return it.

Since the result may be very large, so you need to return a string instead of an integer.

### Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [10,2]
Output: "210"
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [3,30,34,5,9]
Output: "9534330"
```

### Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- 0 <= nums[i] <= $10^9$
