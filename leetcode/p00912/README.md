# 912. Sort an Array

Given an array of integers `nums`, sort the array in ascending order and return it.

You must solve the problem **without using any built-in functions** in `O(nlog(n))` time complexity and with the smallest space complexity possible.

### Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [5,2,3,1]
Output: [1,2,3,5]

Explanation:
 - After sorting the array, the positions of some numbers are not changed (for example, 2 and 3), while the positions of other numbers are changed (for example, 1 and 5).
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [5,1,1,2,0,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,5]

Explanation:
 - Note that the values of nums are not necessairly unique.
```

### Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 5 * $10^4$
- -5 * $10^4$ <= nums[i] <= 5 * $10^4$

# 解題方向

就是把排序算法拿出來複習一次就對了
